- **‚ö° Queue System**: Efficient background processing with priority queues
- **üé® Modern UI**: Built with Flux UI components and Tailwind CSS
- **üîê Authentication**: Complete user authentication and settings management

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Laravel 12.19.3, PHP 8.4
- **Frontend**: Livewire 3.x, Flux UI, Tailwind CSS v4, Alpine.js
- **Database**: SQLite (development) / MySQL (production)
- **Testing**: Pest PHP
- **Build Tools**: Vite
- **API Integration**: Linnworks (read-only)

## Requirements

- PHP 8.4 or higher
- Composer
- Node.js & NPM
- SQLite (development) or MySQL (production)
- Linnworks account with API credentials

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd sales

# Install dependencies
composer install
npm install

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# Activate Flux UI (requires license)
php artisan flux:activate

# Build assets
npm run build
```

### Development

Start all development services with a single command:

```bash
composer dev
```

This runs:
- Laravel development server
- High priority queue worker
- Medium priority queue worker
- Low priority queue worker
- Laravel scheduler
- Log tailing (pail)
- Vite development server

### Linnworks Setup

1. Add your Linnworks credentials to `.env`:
```env
LINNWORKS_APPLICATION_ID=your_app_id
LINNWORKS_APPLICATION_SECRET=your_app_secret
LINNWORKS_TOKEN=your_token
```

2. Test the connection:
```bash
php artisan linnworks:test-connection
```

3. Run initial sync:
```bash
php artisan sync:open-orders
```

For detailed setup instructions, see [Import Setup Guide](docs/getting-started/IMPORT_SETUP.md).

## Key Console Commands

### Scheduled Commands (run automatically)
- `sync:open-orders` - Sync open orders from Linnworks (every 15min)
- `sync:check-processed` - Check for processed orders (every 30min)
- `analytics:refresh-cache` - Refresh analytics cache (every 5min)
- `metrics:refresh-cache` - Refresh metrics cache (every 15min)

### Manual Commands
- `linnworks:sync-detailed-products` - Full product sync with details
- `import:historical-orders` - Import historical order data
- `channel:update-unknown` - Fix unknown channel names
- `safety:check` - Pre-deployment safety checks
- `cache:analytics-status` - View cache status

See [Console Commands](docs/development/CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md#console-commands) for full details.

## Queue System

The application uses a three-tier priority queue system:

- **High Priority** (5min timeout, 3 retries): Order syncs, metrics refresh
- **Medium Priority** (10min timeout, 3 retries): Product syncs, inventory updates
- **Low Priority** (1hr timeout, 2 retries): Historical imports, batch processing

Queue workers are automatically started with `composer dev`.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run specific test suite
vendor/bin/pest --filter=Linnworks

# Run with coverage
vendor/bin/pest --coverage
```

See [Testing Safety](docs/development/TESTING_SAFETY.md) for testing guidelines.

## Architecture

### Service Layer
- `LinnworksApiService`: Main API facade
- `ProductMetricsService`: Product analytics calculations
- `ChannelAnalyticsService`: Channel performance analysis

### Job Queue
- Master jobs: `GetOpenOrderIdsJob`, `GetAllProductsJob`
- Worker jobs: `GetOpenOrderDetailJob`, `ProcessProductJob`
- Rate limiting: `RateLimitLinnworks` middleware

### Key Models
- `Order`: Sales orders with items and totals
- `Product`: Product catalog with pricing and stock
- `OrderItem`: Individual line items
- `SyncLog`: Sync tracking and monitoring

For detailed architecture, see [Codebase Overview](docs/development/CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md).

## Performance

- **Response Caching**: 15-minute cache for API responses
- **Rate Limiting**: 120 req/min (buffer under Linnworks 150/min limit)
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic failure detection and recovery
- **Queue Batching**: Efficient batch processing with delays
- **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries for analytics

## Contributing

1. Follow Laravel coding standards
2. Use Laravel Pint for code formatting: `vendor/bin/pint`
3. Write tests for new features
4. Update documentation for significant changes
